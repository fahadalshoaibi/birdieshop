i forgot to mention that firebase was used for the normal users while admin is hardcoded into db
admin dashboard is for admin only, once admin logs in correctly, he is assigned a token for 1 day, that token is used to verify that the current user is admin if !token, redirect to admin login page
also we got image labeling ai to function , detects single objects with mobilenet and multiple with coco ssd, both via tensorflow
display all products as "50% off"

we planned to use this to create labels for the product and store those labels in the database in order to use them to search for products.


difficulties faced:
implementing AI 
amount of time it took, I was only familiar with javascript going into this project so learning everything that I needed took me alot of time, I was planning on adding features to add reviews and ratings but ran out of time to do so. 
encryption was difficult, used online resources to help
copilot has autofilled incorrect varible names multiple times leading to errors
